## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors, maintainers, and organizers pledge to make participation in Open Source Atria a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Providing helpful and constructive feedback
- Mentoring and supporting newcomers
- Celebrating the achievements of others

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Intimidating or threatening behavior
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Event organizers and project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Event organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Open Source Atria spaces, including but not limited to:

- The OSAtria platform and website
- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Communication channels (Discord, WhatsApp, email lists)
- In-person and virtual events, workshops, and meetups

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is representing the Event or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

**Reporting:** Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the event organizers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

**Confidentiality:** All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases, we may determine that a public statement is required, but will only share details after consulting with the reporter.

**Investigation Process:**

1. Receipt of report and acknowledgment to reporter (within 24 hours)
2. Investigation of the incident (gathering evidence and statements)
3. Decision on appropriate action
4. Communication of decision to involved parties
5. Follow-up to ensure resolution

## Enforcement Guidelines

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from organizers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. Violation of these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
